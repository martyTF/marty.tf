    <div>
      <h2> General Mechachievements</h2>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Robot Related</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Scrapyard Slaughter </h4>
        <p> >Just kill robots. Lots of them. </p>

        <h4> Relentelss Defense </h4>
        <p> >Tomb Adventure (Giza) has by far the most Gatebots in a Mission, so playing it and focusing on the Gate Bots will make the Mechachievement be done in no time.</p>


        <h4> Plus 2 </h4>
        <p> >Can be easily achieved by playing Sniper, Demoman and Spy. First Bonus Objective easier with Sniper and Demoman, Second Bonus Objective best to do with Spy. </p>
        <p> >As Sniper, make sure to get Explosive Headshot Upgrade and headshot a Giant near the Medics, which deals 150 damage at once to every robot close to the Giant.</p>
        <p> >As Demoman, make sure to have at least 2 Stickybombs damaging the Medic, otherwise the Medic will pop Uber. </p>
        <p> >As Spy, the Your Eternal Reward makes it easy to kill lots of tiny robots, including medics, without alerting robots to your presence.</p>
        <p> >For the second Bonus objective, make sure the Giant Medic has less than 938 HP and you have a fully upgraded knife, dealing up to 938 damage on backstab to Giants.</p>
      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Tank Related</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Titanium Tank:</h4>
        <p> >When a tank is destroyed, everyone in the server gets progress for the primary objective.</p>
        <p> >This mechachievement should be obtainable by just playing missions normally, with a focus on tank killers (Phlog/Dragons Fury Pyro, Begga's Soldier and Carbine+Bushwacka Sniper).</p>
        <p> >In Mobocracy (Kelly), with an indefinite amount of tanks spawning in last wave until Segmentation Fault is dead, it is possible to destroy up 10 tanks in that wave alone.</p>

        <h4> Oh, The Humanity</h4>
        <p> >When a blimp is destroyed, everyone in the server gets the mechachievment.</p>
        <p> >Missions with a blimp are: Dust and Dirt, Alpine Skylines, Ground Zero, Mobocracy, Ashes to Ashes, Typhoon Tycoon and Bionic Bits. </p>
      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Misc</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> A Sig-Nificant Upgrade</h4>
        <p> >Play any mission with this <img src="https://creators.tf/cdn/assets/images/tf_campaign/directive/tf_custom_upgrades.png" width="20px" /> icon, primarily found in the Malware Mashup Tour. </p>

        <h4> Bomb Buster </h4>
        <p> >When a sentry buster blows up the bomb carrier, everyone in th server gets the mechachievment. </p>
        <p> >As an Engineer, when there is a sentry buster, try to pick up your sentry and stand next to the bot carrying the bomb. When the sentry buster begins the explode animation, move away and have the bomb carrier be blown up by the sentry buster.</p>
        <p> >Can be made easier by having a Spy sap the bomb carrier so it can't move away from the sentry buster.</p>

        <h4> Do Androids Feel Shame?</h4>
        <p> >When playing on a map with Gatebots (this <img src="https://creators.tf/cdn/assets/images/tf_campaign/directive/tf_gatebot.png" width="20px" /> icon), when the gate is capped, all tiny robots are stunned and can't move. If you have a weapon with a Tauntkill, use it on one of those still standing robots. </p>


        <h4> Unbreaking, Unyielding:</h4>
        <p> >Can be achieved by joining the last wave of a mission and completing it without dying during that last wave. I can recommend using this strat on Mobocracy (Kelly), and staying away from Segmentation Fault, only killing blimps/tanks. It is hard to fail that wave if the team focuses on destroying blimps/tanks while the Red Robots kill Segmentation Fault.</p>
        <p> >Additionally, on Mobocracy, equipping the Solemn Vow as Medic teleports you to spawn when receiving fatal damage, so you can't die. This makes it even more risk free.</p>
      
        <h4> Near Mishap </h4>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6, there's Bomb Runners, who run directly to the hatch trying to deploy the bomb. You just have to airblast those away when they are in the Bomb Deliver Animation. Doing this only twice will complete the Mechachievement. </p>
      
        <h4> Mann Co's Finest</h4>
        <p> >Leaving and reconnecting to a server during setup of last wave will reset wave fails, meaning if you then finish last wave, the mechachievement gets progress, if you fail last wave, simply leave and reconnect again, until you finished the last wave. </p>
      </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Class Mechachievements</h2>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Scout</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Holes in your Pocket </h4>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 5, you get 10,000 cash from the Uber Tank. Just play Scout during that wave and stand near the tank when it dies to collect 50 Contract Points worth of Cash instantly. </p>

        <h4> Dairy Delivery (Mad Milk) </h4>
        <p> >Can also be completed as Medic (requires Mad Milk upgrade for the Syringe Guns). </p>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6, throw Mad Milk at Segmentation Fault, healing all those bots at thousands of HP per minute, easily completing the first bonus objective.</p>
        <p> >Second Bonus Objective requires the "-35% Speed On Target" Upgrade. On Gilded Mainframe (Goldpit) Wave 7, 22 Super Scouts spawn in that wave. If you hit only 15 of them, you can do that second bonus objective in that wave alone.</p>

        <h4> Automation Annoyance (Fan of War, Sandman)</h4>
        <p> >Just hit Giants with the Fan of War and throw Mad Milk at them.</p>
        <p> >Alternatively to the Fan of War, you can use the Sandman with the "Ball Marks Target" upgrade, allowing Scout to mark robots for death from a distance with the Sandman ball.</p>
        <p> >Second Bonus Objective requires you to hit a robot from a very long distance with the Sandman ball. Pick missions on maps with long sightlines for this, e.g. Cliffside and Hoovydam.</p>

        <h4> Scout Has A Gun?</h4>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly), Scout was changed quite drastically into a very strong damage dealer. With the Force'a'Nature, you can deal 100,0000 damage easily. </p>
        <p> >For the first Bonus Objective, use the Crit-a-Cola, as Buff Banner Soldiers tend to stay back a bit away from the frontline, while Scout is the most effective close up.</p>
      
        <h4> Soda Poppin' Specialist (Soda Popper)</h4>
        <p> >On Bionic Bits (Cliffside), Scout has been buffed massively, by turning Scout into Giant Scout, giving him 1600 HP and double damage on Primaries, allowing you to deal massive damage with the Soda Popper while also having enough health to stay in close range for a long amount of time.</p>

      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Soldier</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Doot and Shoot (Buff Banner), Jarhead Juggernaut (Battalion's Backup), Horn-blowing Harbringer (Concheror) </h4>
        <p> >Banners have been buffed massively in both Winterbridge Missions, by charging them with only 3-4 melee hits and lasting twice as long, so using them there will speed up mechachi progress a lot.</p>
        <p> >Banners mechachievements don't progress using Red Robots, meaning doing them on Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6 will not take Red Robots into account.</p>

        <h4> Fighter's Flight</h4>
        <p> >This simply checks for whether you are in the air when you destroy robots. Simply jumping all the time will be enough to complete this mechachievement, no need to be rocketjumping.</p>

        <h4> That's Gotta Sting (W.A.S.P. Launcher)</h4>
        <p> >This requires using the Creators.TF Custom Weapon "The W.A.S.P. Launcher", which can be obtained via the Creators.TF Mann Co. Workshop. </p>
        <p> >Otherwise, play normally using the W.A.S.P. Launcher. </p>

        <h4> Dumpster Nose-Diver (Beggar's Bazooka)</h4>
        <p> >Just play normally with the Beggar's Bazooka, which is the meta weapon for soldiers in MvM. </p>
        <p> >There are some missions that nerfed the Beggar's Bazooka slightly, but it's still very powerful there.</p>
      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pyro</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Backline Burn Hazard (Backburner)</h4>
        <p> >On Bionic Bits (Cliffside) Wave 7, an indefinite amount of Medics spawns that always look towards the final boss. In the time the rest of the team manages to kill the boss, you will have managed to kill up to 50 Medics with Backburner Crits.</p>
        <p> >Reflecting Crit Rockets and killing Robots with it counts towards Backburner Crit Kills.</p>

        <h4> Experimental Eviscerator (Phlogistinator) </h4>
        <p> >On Ocean Commotion (Seabed), Phlogistinator always crits against wet robots. There's also a lot of tiny robots. Just try to camp all the puddles of water and kill robots there. </p>

        <h4>  Propulsion Pilot (Thermal Thruster)</h4>
        <p>  >IMPORTANT: This requires the Stun Upgrade for the Thermal Thruster. </p>
        <p> >On Bionic Bits (Cliffside), the Thermal Thruster has been buffed with instant recharge and infinite redeploys in air, allowing you to constantly use it to stun robots.  </p>
        <p> >There are also more than 30 Medic Robots on Bionic Bits, allowing the first Bonus Objective to be done really easily.</p>

        <h4> Fire and Fury (Dragon's Fury)</h4>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6, you can do both Bonus Objectives easily by focusing tanks when they are active, and Segmentation Fault when there is no tank alive.</p>


      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Demoman</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Tried And True (Stickybomb Launcher), Mannhattan Project (Scottish Resistance) </h4>
        <p> >On Dust and Dirt (Rustvalley), there are many tiny robots in the later waves of the mission, while also having a lot of money, allowing you to destroy many robots really fast.  </p>
        <p> >Equipping the Booties will give you 25 extra health, as you don't need a Grenade Launcher when focusing on Sticky Bombs.</p>
        <h4> Pipe Dream (Grenade Launcher)</h4>
        <p> >Simply play Demoman focusing on the Stock Grenade Launcher and focus tanks for first Bonus Objective. </p>
        <p> >Equipping a Shield (recommended: Chargin' Targe for resistances, Tide Turner for Mobility) will give you bonuses, as you don't need Sticky Bombs when focusing on Grenades. </p>

        <h4> I Don't Need Yer Fancy Tools! (recommended: Eyelander, Scotman' Skullcutter, Half-Zatoichi; also works with all other Demoman Melees)</h4>
        <p> >Do this mechachievement in either of the Medieval MvM missions (Winterbridge), where Demoknight is a meta class.</p>
      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Heavy</button>
      <div class="content">

        <h4> The Immovable Object (Brass Beast)</h4>
        <p> >Simply play Heavy with the Brass Beast.</p>

        <h4> The (Un)stoppable Force (Natasha)</h4>
        <p> >Play missions with a lot of Giant Scouts, e.g. Gilded Mainframe (Goldpit) with 37 Giant Scouts in total.</p>

        <h4> Elongated Drage (Huo-Long Heater)</h4>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly), the Huo Long heater shoots flares, thus igniting enemies from any range, meaning you can set a lot of enemies on fire by shooting them, without needing robots to get close to you to step in the ring of fire.</p>

        <h4> We Fight Like Men (Killing Gloves of Boxing)</h4>
        <p> >Do this mechachievement in either of the Medieval MvM missions (Winterbridge), where KGB Heavy is a meta class.</p>


      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Engineer</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Ranger Danger (Rescue Ranger, Gamma Gazer) </h4>
        <p> >Repairing your Building can be done either via Rescue Ranger or any Wrench. </p>
        <p> >Saving your building can be done either via Rescue Ranger or Creators.TF custom weapon Gamma Gazer, using the rightclick to teleport building to you.</p>

        <h4> I Am The Defense! (Widowmaker)  </h4>
        <p> >Using the Creators.TF custom weapon Gamma Gazer allows you to teleport buildings to you with your Secondary, meaning you don't have to use the Rescue Ranger, allowing you to use other Engineer Primaries. </p>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6, you can just keep shooting Segmentation Fault for the Primary Objective, and Tanks while they're active for the first Bonus Objective. </p>

        <h4> Robotic Revenge (Frontier Justice)</h4>
        <p> >On Sudden Equinox (Sharp), Ashes to Ashes (Cliffside) and Voidlings (Booge), the Gunslinger has been buffed massively, which allows for perfect pairing with the Frontier Justice, as any of your 4 possible minisentries going down contribute to revenge crits while you can still have your 3 other Minisentries active and always place a new one down. </p>
        <p> >When doing the second Bonus Objective, make sure to deal 150 damage at once, as doing any less will make the Medic pop.</p>
        <p> >Best Missions for killing Uber Medics are: Voidlings (Booge) with 51 and Ashes to Ashes (Cliffside) with 46, these 2 missions have the Gunslinger Buff and therefore Frontier Justice Buff; or you play Equal Opposites (Goldpit) with 94 and Typhoon Tycoon (Hanami) with 60, those missions do not have the Gunslinger Buff.</p>

        <h4> Short Circuited (Short Circuit) </h4>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6, or any mission with a Sticky Tank (e.g. Dynamic Disaster (Autumnnull), Tincan Termination (Autumnnull) or Binoic Bits (Cliffside)), spamming it to delete Seg's rocket or the Sticky Tank stickies will complete the mechachievement within a single wave. </p>

        <h4> Let's Get Wranglin' (Wrangler)</h4>
        <p> >You can complete the mechachievement by just playing Engineer normally, as you only need to deal damage with your Sentry Gun.</p>
        <p> >The Bonus Objective requires you to just play with the Wrangler like you normally do.</p>

      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Medic</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> The Assistant </h4>
        <p> >Play medic and heal your teammates, to get a lot of assists focus healing on Heavy and Soldier if you have a good one, as those get the most kills normally. </p>

        <h4> Lactose Intolerance (Syringe Gun, Overdose, Blutsauger) </h4>
        <p> >IMPORTANT: Requires the Upgrade "Mad Milk Syringes" for the Stock Syringe Gun, The Blutsauger or the Overdose.
        <p> >In Mobocracy (Kelly), hitting Segmentation Fault with the Mad Milk Syringes will make you complete the Mechachievement very fast.</p>

        <h4> Preventive Care (Quick-Fix)</h4>
        <p> >Just play normally with the Quick-Fix. </p>
        <p> >For the first Bonus Objective, simply make sure to be below 50 HP when using Quick-Fix Uber. </p>

        <h4> Anti-Robotic Resistant Bugs (Vaccinator) </h4>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6, using Mad Milk syringes on Segmentation Fault will make the Red Robots damaging Seg will make you gain 100% Übercharge within a fraction of a second. Then, get Seg's attention, activate Explosion Vaccinator Bubble, and you will resist several hundreds of damage per barrage. Do this the entire fight against Seg, and you should have the mechachievement completed.</p>

        <h4> Critical Mass (Kritzkrieg)</h4>
        <p> >Just play normally with the Kritzkrieg.</p>
        <p> >The second Bonus Objective requires the "Canteen Sharing" upgrade, recommended canteen when running Kritzkrieg is the Uber Canteen.</p>
     
        <h4> PCB Plowing </h4>
        <p> >IMPORTANT: Requires the "Projectile Shield" on any Medigun.</p>
        <p> >On Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6, using the Shield to block the rockets of Segmentation Fault and damage him, while healing the Red Robots will make you complete the Contract very fast.</p>
      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Sniper</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> Hitman House-Keeping (Hitman's Heatmaker) </h4>
        <p> >Simply play Sniper normally with the Hitman's Heatmaker. </p>

        <h4>Precise Power </h4>
        <p> >Focus on Giant Robots, slow ones like Soldiers and Heavies are recommended for that. </p>

        <h4> Bazaar Botbash (Bazaar Bargain) </h4>
        <p> >Using Explosive Headshots, you can get heads for the Primary Objective by just shooting one robot in the head and killing others via EH. </p>
        <p> >Unlike the other Sniper Primaries, Bazaar Bargain is better when charging shots and no quickshotting a lot. </p>
        
        <h4> Not An Oil Substitute (Jarate) </h4>
        <p> >IMPORTANT: Requires the "-35% Speed on Target" upgrade. </p>
        <p> >On Gilded Mainframe (Goldpit) Wave 7, 22 Super Scouts spawn in that wave. If you hit only 5 of them, you can do the first bonus objective in that wave alone.</p>

        <h4> Australian Tank Repair (Cleaner's Carbine + Bushwacka) </h4>
        <p> >Use the Cleaner's Carbine to fill the Crikey Meter, activate it by rightclicking when you have the CLeaner's Carbine active, then switch to the Bushwacka and hit the tank with it to deal Crits while Crikey is active. </p>
        <p> >Do this on missions with a lot of Tanks, e.g. Carburated Clash (Estate) with 6 Tanks + Support Tanks, Ground Zero (Silentsky) with 8 Tanks or Mobocracy (Kelly) Wave 6 with several Support Tanks as long as Segmentation Fault is alive.</p>


      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Spy</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h4> White-Glove Service (Your Eternal Reward) </h4>
        <p> >The YER has been buffed to now work properly, where it instantly disguises you as the robot you backstabbed. </p>
        <p> >Focus tiny robots, especially medics with the YER. </p>

        <h4> Steel Lifesteal (Conniver's Kunai) </h4>
        <p> >Just play normally with the Conniver's Kunai, focusing Giants but also using normal robots to heal off. </p>

        <h4> Evade and Cower (Big Earner, Dead Ringer) </h4>
        <p> >Get a backstab on a normal Robot to get the speed boost, then focus Giants by circle-strafing them allowing you to backstab a Giant several times. </p>
        <p> >You can do the Second Bonus Objective with any Melee, as long as you use the Dead Ringer.</p>

        <h4> Short-Circuit Saboteur (Sapper)</h4>
        <p> >Buy one tick of the Sapper upgrade to stun multiple robots at once. </p>
        <p> >Focus the sapper on normal Scouts and Giant Scouts, and then backstab them while they're stunned/slow.</p>
