    <h1>This is very much WIP. However, information should still be accurate.</h1>
	
	<h2> Platinum Palliative</h2>
	<h4> </h4>
	<p> </p>
	
	
	<h2> Malware Mashup</h2>
	<h3> Bionic Bits (Cliffside) </h3>
	<p> >Sandmann Scout has permanent Crits on Melee and does increased Melee damage, can easily top damage, also outheals the damage of all bosses when the boss is covered in milk.</p>
	<p> >Wave 6 has like 80% Fists of Steel Heavies, half of them have an invisible Razorback, making Spy only half useful. However, Demoknight absolutely destroys that wave, as a fully upgraded Sword can deal 130 base damage on 4 x 25% damage increase upgrade, doubled with the FoS downside, tripled due to the crits on kill upgrade, allowing Demoknight to chew through them, and still do solid damage to the Cloaked Heavies. Rather weak against the Wave's boss, but that boss isn't that strong anyway. </p>
    <h3> Ocean Commotion (Seabed)</h3>
	<p> >Huntsman creates 3 Arrows in a quite narrow spread, allowing for triple damage per shot for free. Projectile Penetration Upgrade is broken tho, don't use it.</p>
	<p> >It's better to set up at the first gate, where the 3 spawn paths merge, than trying to split up and take care of each path with only 3 people or constantly switching. Just make sure to not have the gate capped, as it becomes substantially more difficult after that.</p>
	<h3> Mobocracy (Kelly)</h3>
	<p> >Money doesn't drop from robots. However, Scout has been slightly buffed to keep him viable, but now only works as a support/damage class.</p>
	<p> >IMPORTANT: Last Robot drops all the Cash of a Wave. If you fail to pick up that cash pile, you will lose out on a whole wave's money.</p>
	<p> >The Mini-Sentry Upgrade for Engineer's cost has changed from costing 500 Credit to -500 Credits, essentially giving you 500 Credits when buying it. That means you can go Engineer, buy the Upgrade, get those 500 Credits, switch back to the class you want to play as, and then have 500 more Credits to upgrade from wave 1 on. </p>
	<p> >The Negotiator will turn any player it hits blu for a short while, meaning Red Robots and Sentries will automatically target and kill that player. It's best to either wait until you turn back to Red Team or just killbind or get killed to respawn as Red player again.</p>
	<p> >Gaben (Wave 4) needs to be protected at all cost. If Gaben dies, then an indefinite amount of Giant Crit Soldiers will spawn, making the rest of the Mission a lot harder.</p>
	<p> >Segmentation Fault can not deliver the Bomb, only Tanks/Blimps can. Thus it's much more important to focus the Tanks and Blimps, while the Red Robots damage Segmentation Fault.</p>
